### [Match Literal Strings](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/match-literal-strings)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
This challenge is not any different from the previous; in this case though, you are learning that string literals are case-sensitive.  That means, when you test to see if a string has a literal, it will search for the exact case (lower or upper) inside the string.

## HINTS
Change the line to have the correct string literal.
